# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

## Photo Collage Maker (Custom UI)

A modern, lightweight photo collage maker allows you to:
- Upload multiple images
- Arrange them in a drag-and-drop grid
- Adjust rows, columns, spacing, size, and background
- Download the composed collage as a single PNG image

### How to Use

1. **Add Images**: Click "+ Add Images" and select photos from your device. They appear in the collage grid preview.
2. **Arrange**: Drag images to reorder them. Each can be removed using the "×" button.
3. **Adjust Grid**: Use the controls to set number of rows/columns, spacing (gap), and canvas size or background color. The preview updates instantly.
4. **Download**: Click "Download Collage" to export the current arrangement as a single PNG image.

*All processing is local; no photos are uploaded to a server. Controls are keyboard-accessible and fully responsive.*

### Export notes

- Collage images are composed with object-fit:cover (default) behavior.
- The exported PNG reflects the current grid, arrangement, and settings.

## Getting Started

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
